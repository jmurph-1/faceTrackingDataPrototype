## Dependencies and Constraints

**Dependencies:**
*   **Software Frameworks:** MediaPipe framework (specific tasks: Face Landmarker 478-point model, Multi-class Image Segmenter), Apple's Metal framework, Core Graphics, AVFoundation (for camera access).
*   **Hardware:** Requires an iOS device equipped with a functional camera (preferably front-facing for analysis). Adequate processing capabilities on the device are necessary for real-time MediaPipe/Metal operations.
*   **Operating System:** iOS 13.0 or newer.

**Constraints:**
*   **Lighting Conditions:** The accuracy of the color analysis is significantly influenced by external factors, particularly the quality and consistency of natural or artificial lighting during the video capture. Suboptimal lighting may reduce accuracy.
*   **Camera Quality:** The resolution and color fidelity of the device's camera hardware can impact the precision of the color extraction and segmentation.
*   **Analysis Model Limitations:** The accuracy of the seasonal assignment is dependent on the robustness and training data of the underlying algorithm/model used to interpret facial data and classify into 12 seasons. Edge cases or individuals with unique coloring may be challenging for the model.
*   **Device Performance Variability:** While Metal is used, real-time performance may still vary across the wide range of supported iOS devices, potentially impacting the smoothness of the analysis experience on older models.

## Risk Assessment

**R-1.0 Analysis Accuracy and User Satisfaction:**
*   **Description:** The core function, assigning a season, might not be perceived as accurate by all users, especially given the subjectivity sometimes involved in color analysis or variations in user input conditions. This could lead to dissatisfaction and lack of trust in the app.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement a highly robust and well-tested analysis algorithm. Provide clear guidance to users on optimal conditions for running the analysis (e.g., lighting, no makeup). Consider including an option for users to manually select or adjust their season if they strongly disagree, perhaps with an explanation of why the analysis suggested differently. Collect user feedback on results to refine the model over time.

**R-2.0 Performance Bottlenecks on Older Devices:**
*   **Description:** Real-time processing with MediaPipe and Metal, while optimized, could still strain resources on older iOS devices, leading to a poor user experience (lagging video, dropped frames).
*   **Mitigation:** Conduct extensive performance testing on the minimum and typical target devices. Optimize the processing pipeline further. Consider implementing mechanisms to adapt processing quality based on device performance if possible, or clearly state minimum recommended devices.

**R-3.0 Integration Complexity of Core Technologies:**
*   **Description:** Integrating MediaPipe, Metal, and the analysis algorithm into a stable, performant, and user-friendly application is technically challenging and requires specialized skills.
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure the development team has strong experience with iOS development, real-time processing, and the specific frameworks (MediaPipe, Metal). Dedicate sufficient time for prototyping and technical spikes for core components. Implement thorough unit and integration testing for the analysis pipeline.

**R-4.0 Content Richness and Depth:**
*   **Description:** Providing detailed, accurate, and truly *personalized* styling recommendations for 12 distinct seasons and variations within them requires significant expertise and content creation. Ensuring this content is valuable and easy to apply is crucial.
*   **Mitigation:** Collaborate with experienced color analysis or styling experts to develop comprehensive and nuanced content for each season and common sub-variations within seasons. Design the personalized section (FR-3.0) to clearly articulate *why* certain recommendations are made for the user's specific coloring. Plan for ongoing content updates and refinement based on user feedback.

**R-5.0 User Privacy Concerns:**
*   **Description:** Processing user's live facial data is sensitive. Despite local processing, users may still have concerns about how their image data is used and stored.
*   **Mitigation:** Be transparent about how data is processed (locally on device). Implement strong security measures for saved results. Provide a clear and easily accessible privacy policy. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Only request camera access when actively performing the analysis.
