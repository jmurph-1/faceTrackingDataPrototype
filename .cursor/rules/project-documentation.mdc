**CRITICAL RULE: Always Update Project Directory Documentation**

When making ANY of the following changes to the project:
- Adding new files (.swift, .metal, .md, etc.)
- Removing or renaming existing files  
- Adding new functionality or features
- Modifying existing services, utilities, or components
- Updating the Core Data model
- Adding new dependencies or frameworks
- Changing the app architecture or flow

**YOU MUST ALSO UPDATE** `ImageSegmenter/Knowledge/projectDirectory.md` to reflect these changes by:

1. Adding new files to the appropriate sections with accurate descriptions
2. Updating existing descriptions to reflect new functionality
3. Modifying dependency relationships if the processing pipeline changed
4. Adding details to the "Recent Updates" section
5. Updating technology stack if new frameworks/libraries are added

This ensures the project documentation stays current and accurate for future development and team onboarding.
