# colorAnalysisApp Technology Stack

**Version: 2.0**
**Date: December 2024**
**Status: In Active Development**

## 1. Project Overview

The `colorAnalysisApp` is a native iOS mobile application that provides comprehensive color analysis for users based on the 12 seasonal color analysis system. The app captures facial images in real-time, analyzes skin and hair colors, calculates contrast levels between facial features, and provides personalized styling recommendations based on the user's assigned season and contrast characteristics.

## 2. Current Implementation Summary

The application is built as a native iOS app using Swift and Xcode, leveraging Apple's core frameworks and advanced color science. The unique color analysis feature is powered by MediaPipe framework for facial landmark detection and image segmentation, with Metal providing high-performance real-time GPU rendering. The app features sophisticated contrast analysis using Lab color space and CIEDE2000 Delta-E calculations for perceptually accurate color difference measurements. Local persistence handles user analysis results with comprehensive data modeling including contrast metrics.
