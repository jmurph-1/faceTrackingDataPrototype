    *   Performance issues when loading pages with many images (ensure images are optimized).

### 5.2. Run Color Analysis

*   **Description:** Guides the user through the process of performing a personal color analysis using the device's camera and MediaPipe technology.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to initiate the color analysis process easily from the app's main screen.
    *   As a user performing the analysis, I want clear instructions on how to position myself and what conditions are necessary for an accurate result.
    *   As a user, I want visual feedback during the analysis process (e.g., seeing the facial landmarks or segmentation outlines).
    *   As a user, I want the app to process my features using the camera feed to determine my color season.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC1: A prominent call-to-action (e.g., "Analyze My Colors") is available on the main screen.
    *   AC2: Upon initiating analysis, the app checks for and requests camera permissions if necessary.
    *   AC3: If permissions are granted, the app opens a view displaying the live camera feed, optimized for portrait orientation.
    *   AC4: On-screen instructions and visual guides are displayed to help the user:
        *   Position their face correctly within a designated area (e.g., an oval overlay).
        *   Ensure good, natural lighting.
        *   Recommend pulling hair back and removing glasses/hats (as these interfere with analysis).
        *   Maintain a neutral facial expression.
    *   AC5: The app actively uses MediaPipe Face Landmarker to detect a single face and provides real-time visual confirmation (e.g., the designated area turns green, a message says "Face Detected"). (Prototype's overlay visualization can be used here, perhaps simplified or optional for the user).
    *   AC6: Once a stable, suitable facial input is detected, the app indicates readiness for analysis or automatically proceeds to capture and process.
    *   AC7: The app utilizes MediaPipe Image Segmenter to segment facial features (skin, hair, eyes, lips, eyebrows) from the captured input (video stream or key frames). (Prototype's highlighting can be a subtle part of the visual feedback or background process).
    *   AC8: The app extracts average color values (RGB and/or HSV) from key segmented regions (primarily skin and hair, potentially eyes) for use in the analysis algorithm. (The prototype's real-time display of values is a technical detail that won't be shown to the user in the final product flow).
    *   AC9: The application processes the extracted color data and landmark information through an internal algorithm to determine the most probable seasonal color palette(s) for the user.
    *   AC10: During the processing phase, a clear progress indicator or animation is displayed to the user.
    *   AC11: Upon completion of processing, the app automatically navigates the user to the Personalized Season Result page (Feature 5.3).
    *   AC12: A "Cancel" button is available during the setup and processing phase to allow the user to exit the analysis flow.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Camera permission denied by the user.
    *   No face detected in the frame.
    *   Multiple faces detected in the frame.
    *   Insufficient lighting conditions (app should warn the user).
    *   User moves out of frame during analysis.
    *   Facial features obscured (hair, glasses, heavy makeup) - app should ideally detect and warn.
    *   Processing fails due to unexpected input or resource constraints.
    *   Device storage is critically low (though analysis is mostly computation).
    *   App is interrupted (phone call, backgrounded) during analysis (should handle state or require restart).
    *   Device performance is low, leading to choppy feed or slow processing (requires optimization, Metal helps here).

### 5.3. View Personalized Season Result

*   **Description:** Displays the result of the color analysis, including the assigned season and a personalized season page tailored to the user's unique features.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want to see my assigned color season clearly displayed after the analysis.
    *   As a user, I want to access a personalized version of my assigned season's page with details relevant to my analysis.
    *   As a user, I want to understand *why* I was assigned this season based on the analysis findings.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC1: Immediately after analysis completion, the user is taken to a "Result" screen.
    *   AC2: The Result screen clearly states the assigned seasonal palette (e.g., "You are a True Summer").
    *   AC3: The Result screen provides a brief overview or justification for the assigned season, potentially mentioning how the user's specific hair, skin, and eye characteristics fit the profile.
    *   AC4: A button or link allows the user to view their "Personalized [Assigned Season Name]" page.
    *   AC5: The Personalized Season page is based on the corresponding Default Season page content (palette, characteristics, styling recommendations).
    *   AC6: The Personalized Season page incorporates nuances or highlights related to the user's specific analysis results (e.g., "Your analysis shows you lean towards the lighter end of the Summer palette," or "Your specific skin tone within the Autumn season looks particularly good in [specific shade]"). The level of personalization needs definition - could be subtle text tweaks or highlighting specific colors within the palette based on analysis details.
    *   AC7: The Personalized Season page maintains the unique look and feel of the assigned seasonal palette.
    *   AC8: Users can navigate back from the Personalized Season page to the Result screen or their saved results list.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Analysis algorithm fails to confidently assign a single season (Needs a fallback strategy - maybe suggest checking multiple closest seasons, or indicate a blend). *Initial MVP might require a definitive assignment.*
    *   Personalization logic doesn't yield specific insights for a user (fallback to displaying mostly the default information).
    *   Result page fails to load content.

### 5.4. Manage Saved Analysis Results

*   **Description:** Allows users to save their analysis results and view past results.
*   **User Stories:**

    *   As a user, I want to view a list of my past analysis results.
    *   As a user, I want to revisit the Personalized Season page for any of my saved results.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC1: On the Result screen (after analysis), a prominent "Save Result" button is available.
    *   AC2: Tapping "Save Result" stores the analysis outcome (assigned season, and potentially key analysis data points or parameters used for personalization) locally on the device.
    *   AC3: The app includes a section or screen (e.g., "My Results") listing all saved analysis results.
    *   AC4: Each entry in the "My Results" list displays the assigned season and the date/time of the analysis.
    *   AC5: Tapping an entry in the "My Results" list navigates the user to the corresponding Personalized Season page for that saved result.
    *   AC6: Users have the option to delete saved results (e.g., via swipe-to-delete or edit mode).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Device storage is full, preventing saving (app should inform the user).
    *   Data corruption prevents loading a saved result (graceful failure, maybe offer to delete).
    *   User tries to save a result without completing the analysis.

### 5.5. Unique Season Styling & UI

*   **Description:** Implementation of distinct visual themes, color palettes, and emotional/abstract concepts for each of the 12 season pages (both default and personalized).
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a user, I want each season page to feel distinct and visually representative of the colors and mood of that palette.
    *   As a user, I want the app's overall design to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   AC1: Each of the 12 season pages (default and personalized) uses a primary color palette derived from the actual seasonal colors.
    *   AC2: UI elements (backgrounds, text colors, accents, dividers) within a season page adhere to the assigned season's palette and aesthetic guidelines.
    *   AC3: Visual assets (icons, illustrations, potential background textures) used on season pages evoke the "feeling" of that season (e.g., bright and fresh for Spring, deep and rich for Winter).
    *   AC4: Typography choices (fonts, weights) are consistent across the app but might have subtle variations or specific pairings used within certain season themes to enhance the mood.
    *   AC5: The overall UI design is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.
    *   AC6: The unique styling does not impede readability or accessibility.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Poor color contrast between text and background within a specific season's theme, impacting readability (requires design review and testing).
    *   Inconsistent application of styling across different elements on the page.
    *   Performance issues due to complex styling or large assets.

## 6. Technical Requirements

*   **Development Environment:** Xcode 16.3, Swift 6.1, targeting iOS 13.0+
*   **Core Technologies:**
    *   MediaPipe framework:
        *   Face Landmarker (specifically the 478-point model) for precise facial geometry detection.
        *   Image Segmenter (multi-class model) for separating background, skin, hair, eyes, lips, eyebrows.
    *   Metal framework: For high-performance, GPU-accelerated rendering of the camera feed, overlays, and potentially processing outputs.
    *   Core ML (potential): While MediaPipe handles the core models, Core ML might be considered for optimizing model execution on Apple silicon, if MediaPipe's performance isn't sufficient out-of-the-box or for future custom models.
*   **Architecture:** MVVM or similar pattern recommended for separation of concerns (UI, ViewModel, Model/Data/Processing Logic).
*   **Color Analysis Algorithm:**
    *   Needs to be developed or integrated based on seasonal color theory principles.
    *   Input: Extracted average color values (RGB/HSV/Lab?) for skin, hair, eyes, and potentially other metrics derived from landmarks (e.g., face shape characteristics, eyebrow shape/angle might contribute to season nuances).
    *   Output: Assignment to one of the 12 seasons and potentially parameters for personalization.
    *   Consider color space: Analysis should ideally be done in a color space more perceptually uniform than RGB (e.g., Lab or LCH) to accurately compare colors.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Local device storage for saving user analysis results and preferences. Options include Core Data, Realm, or simple file serialization (e.g., Codable). Core Data or Realm are preferable for managing structured results.
    *   Default season data (text descriptions, color values, recommendations, UI styling parameters) should be bundled within the app resources (e.g., JSON files, property lists, or integrated into the data model).
*   **Performance:**
    *   Real-time video processing for analysis setup requires stable high frame rates (e.g., 30 fps) using MediaPipe and Metal.
    *   Color analysis calculation should be fast, ideally completing within a few seconds after input capture.
    *   UI rendering must be smooth, especially on season pages with potentially rich visuals.
    *   Efficient memory management is crucial to avoid crashes, particularly during video processing.
*   **Camera Usage:** Proper handling of AVCaptureSession, camera permissions, device orientation, and potential interruptions. Ensure background processing is handled correctly if analysis takes time (though local processing should be quick enough to avoid backgrounding issues).
*   **Concurrency:** Use of Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) or Swift Concurrency (Actors, Async/Await) for managing background tasks like analysis processing without blocking the main UI thread. MediaPipe delegates might operate on separate threads, requiring thread-safe data handling.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for camera access, MediaPipe model loading/execution failures, data storage issues, and analysis algorithm edge cases.
*   **Localization (Future):** Design should consider potential future localization for season names and descriptions.
