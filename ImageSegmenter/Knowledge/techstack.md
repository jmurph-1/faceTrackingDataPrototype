# colorAnalysisApp Technology Stack

**Version: 2.0**
**Date: December 2024**
**Status: In Active Development**

## 1. Project Overview

The `colorAnalysisApp` is a native iOS mobile application that provides comprehensive color analysis for users based on the 12 seasonal color analysis system. The app captures facial images in real-time, analyzes skin and hair colors, calculates contrast levels between facial features, and provides personalized styling recommendations based on the user's assigned season and contrast characteristics. The application now features AI-powered personalized recommendations through OpenAI API integration, delivering custom color advice, styling tips, and detailed analysis tailored to each user's unique coloring profile.

## 2. Current Implementation Summary

The application is built as a native iOS app using Swift and Xcode, leveraging Apple's core frameworks and advanced color science. The unique color analysis feature is powered by MediaPipe framework for facial landmark detection and image segmentation, with Metal providing high-performance real-time GPU rendering. The app features sophisticated contrast analysis using Lab color space and CIEDE2000 Delta-E calculations for perceptually accurate color difference measurements. Local persistence handles user analysis results with comprehensive data modeling including contrast metrics. 

The application now includes AI-powered personalization through OpenAI API integration, providing users with detailed, customized color recommendations based on their unique facial coloring. The enhanced workflow features intelligent frame processing optimization, advanced timing coordination between analysis and personalization, and dual-view presentation with seamless fallback handling. The 12-season classification system provides both macro and detailed season identification, enabling precise personalized recommendations while maintaining UI compatibility.
